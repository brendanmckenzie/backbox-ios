# backbox
---------

BackBox is an example application to get used to programming again.

I had an idea when stranded in Dong Hui, Vietnam trying to find a way back to civilisation.  I realised that having the ability to communicate with other people around me - preferably other travelers in a similar situation - could have been beneficial in organising a chartered bus instead of working with unhelpful locals.

The idea was shelved whilst I continued traveling but now that I am in possession of a computer again and have the time to work on it, the project has become active.

In addition to being an application for users the main driving factor behind actually coding this app was to get some self exposure to the open source community by releasing this project to the world without any conditions to prove that I'm actually a capable coder ;)

## iOS

This is the mobile - specificaly iOS - portion of the service.

There are four parts to it.

 1. The service - the backend that connects everything
 2. The mobile applications (iOS, Android, Windows Phone)
 3. The website
 4. The administration portal
